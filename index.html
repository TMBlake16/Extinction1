				<h2>About</h2>
						<p>The Smilodon is a saber-tooth cat that lived during the Pleistoncene era. It was named in 1842 by Peter Wilhelm Lund. They were mostly found living in North and South America. The Smilodon was aroung the same size as the big cats we see today , but was mostly robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, broad limbs and short feet. It was manily known for its long sharp teeth, which were 28 cm, the longest foud in the sbaer-tooth cats.It had strong cheek bones, a short proportional muzzle, and large cranium.  </p>
						<h3>Habitat</h3>
						<p>The Smilodon lived in the closed habitats such as the forest. They lived where there was a high vegetation of tress, shurbs, and grasses in the southwest whcih also created a home for larger animals such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Smilodon gracilis entered South America from early to middle Pleistocene, which gave growth to the Smilodon population.  </p>

				<h4>Predatoral Behavior</h4>
						<p>Smilodon mostly hunted large animals. They mostly hunted bison and camels. They killed their prey by biting the neck and cutting the jugular vein or trachea. Even though the Smilodon is stronger than most animals, it has a weak bite. Big cats today have more pronouced zygomatic arches while in the Smilodon they were smaller which took away the thickness and poer of the temporalis muscles. Smilodons begin developing theirsaber teeth once they reach one and half years of age.   </p>
						<h5>Extinction</h5>
						<p>Along with most of the Pleistocene megafanuna, the Smilodon becam extinct 10,000 years ago inthe Quaternary extinction event. Its extinction was also part of the decline and extinction of larger herbivores which were then replaced by smaller and more agile animals like deer. Many say that they were extincted due to climate change and competition of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event. </p>
