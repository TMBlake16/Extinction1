					<h2>About</h2>
						<p>The Smilodon is a saber-tooth cat that lived during the Pleistoncene era. It was named in 1842 by Peter Wilhelm Lund. They were mostly found living in North and South America. The Smilodon was aroung the same size as the big cats we see today , but was mostly robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, broad limbs and short feet. It was manily known for its long sharp teeth, which were 28 cm, the longest foud in the sbaer-tooth cats.It had strong cheek bones, a short proportional muzzle, and large cranium.  </p>
					<h2>Predatoral Behavior</h2>
						<p>Smilodon mostly hunted large animals. They mostly hunted bison and camels. They killed their prey by biting the neck and cutting the jugular vein or trachea. Even though the Smilodon is stronger than most animals, it has a weak bite. Big cats today have more pronouced zygomatic arches while in the Smilodon they were smaller which took away the thickness and poer of the temporalis muscles.   </p>
